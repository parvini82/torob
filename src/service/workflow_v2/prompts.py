- Construction details (seams, stitching, hardware)

DISTINCTIVE FEATURES:
- Functional elements (pockets, buttons, zippers, closures)
- Design details (collars, sleeves, hemlines, cuts)
- Branding elements (logos, labels, distinctive marks)
- Fit characteristics (slim, relaxed, tailored, oversized)

TECHNICAL ASPECTS:

The garment displays a subtle herringbone weave pattern with contrasting dark buttons and interior burgundy lining visible at the cuffs. Features include two front flap pockets, chest welt pocket, and side vents. The tailored fit suggests business formal categorization with modern slim-cut silhouette. Fabric appears to be mid-weight suiting material with slight texture variation indicating wool-polyester blend construction."
